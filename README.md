## üéØ What is LongTube?

LongTube is a browser extension that removes all short-form content from your YouTube UI.

Short-form content is engineered to be addictive. It hijacks your attention and leaves you doom-scrolling brain-rot
content.

LongTube is an opt-out for the times you want to focus on long-form content.

## üöÄ Features

- **üö´ Removes all Shorts** from YouTube's UI
- **‚Ü™Ô∏è Redirects** away from Shorts URLs
- **üìä Tracks** how many Shorts you've avoided
- **üîì Open source** forever

## üì¶ Installation

The extension has been submitted to the Chrome Web Store and the Firefox Add-Ons registry, but for now you can add
it locally.

### Download Release

## ü§ù Contributing

I vibe-coded this for myself because I was tired of being force fed short-form content without the ability to opt-out. It happens to work really well, so I thought I'd share it with others.

Feel free to use it, share it, or contribute.
