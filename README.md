## 🎯 What is LongTube?

LongTube is a browser extension that removes all short-form content from your YouTube UI.

Short-form content is engineered to be addictive. It hijacks your attention and leaves you doom-scrolling brain-rot
content.

LongTube is an opt-out for the times you want to focus on long-form content.

## 🚀 Features

- **🚫 Removes all Shorts** from YouTube's UI.
- **↪️ Redirects** away from Shorts URLs.

## 🤝 Contributing
