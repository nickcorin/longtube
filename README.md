## 🎯 Why LongTube?

Short-form content is engineered to be addictive. It hijacks your attention span, fragments your focus, and leaves you scrolling endlessly through meaningless content. **LongTube helps you take back control.**

- **🧠 Protect Your Focus** - Short-form content trains your brain to crave constant stimulation
- **⏰ Reclaim Your Time** - The average person wastes 2+ hours daily on Shorts
- **📚 Choose Depth Over Dopamine** - Long-form content builds knowledge; Shorts build addiction
- **🎬 Support Real Creators** - Encourage thoughtful content over viral snippets

## ✨ Features

- **🚫 Total Shorts Elimination** - Removes Shorts from every corner of YouTube
- **🔄 Anti-Shorts Redirect** - Caught clicking a Short? We'll redirect you to better content
- **📊 Reality Check Stats** - See exactly how much mindless content you've avoided
- **⚡ Zero-Tolerance Blocking** - Shorts are hidden before they can even load
- **🔒 Privacy-First Design** - No tracking, no data collection, just protection

## 🚀 Installation

### Quick Install

## 💪 How It Works

2. **DOM Patrol** - Continuously monitors and removes new Shorts as they appear
3. **Smart Detection** - Identifies Shorts in search, homepage, sidebar, and channels
4. **Redirect Protection** - Navigating to a `/shorts/` URL? Not on our watch

The extension shows you:

- **Shorts Blocked** - Your shield count against mind-numbing content
