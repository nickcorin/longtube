# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 2024

## Introduction

LongTube ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our browser extension handles information.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any personal information.**

LongTube operates entirely locally on your device. We do not:

- Collect personal data
- Track user behavior
- Use analytics services
- Transmit data to external servers
- Store data on remote servers

## Local Data Storage

The extension stores minimal data locally on your device using the browser's storage API:

- **User Preferences**: Extension enabled/disabled state, theme preference
- **Usage Statistics**: Count of blocked content (stored locally only)

This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

## Permissions

LongTube requires these permissions to function:

- **Storage**: To save your preferences locally
- **Active Tab**: To modify YouTube pages you visit

These permissions are used solely for the extension's functionality and not for data collection.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or disclose any information because we do not collect any information.

## Third-Party Services

LongTube does not integrate with any third-party services or send data to external servers.

## Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be reflected by changing the "Effective Date" above.
